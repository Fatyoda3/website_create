          organizational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
          nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by

          2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and
          the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as
          the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of
          education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
          recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
          India's highest civilian honour.
